- I started to learn software engineering much time ago and had a big difficulties. I gave up
and I fully switched my way to other direction. I realized there are no other ways to use my brain
as I want like engineering. As my teacher says: "Think as an engineer". Liked this idea and I follow it.
So after 1 year I came back with new wise and sharp thinking to learn most power of programming.
